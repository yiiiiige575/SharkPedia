## Background

In term of the increasing number of shark attacks in Australia and the fact that they often caused by water sports, this raises concerns about people being attacked by sharks while doing water sports. The aim of our project is to address these concerns by providing shark attack cases 、 shark popular science and shark distribution map. 

## Progress

Iteration 1: Developing features about [Shark Facts] and [Survival Skills], which can provide the  professional shark science and shark survival knowledge to  reduce the risk of being attacked by sharks 

Iteration 2: Developing the feature about [Attack Cases], which can provide the shark distribution map to help people know where are the sharks.

Iteration 3: Developing features about [Shark Album] and [Report Shark], which can provide shark retrieval to help humans get more detailed shark information. .
